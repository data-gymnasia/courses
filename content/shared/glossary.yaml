# NEURAL NETS GLOSSARY
# ==============================================================================

word:
  title: Word
  text: A word is a single distinct meaningful element of speech or writing.

receptive-field:
  title: Receptive field
  text: The receptive field of a neuron is the set of neurons whose values
    contribute to that neuron's value, based on the architecture of the neural network.
    For example, the receptive field of a neuron in a dense layer includes the entire
    preceding layer, while the receptive field of a neuron in a convolutional
    or subsampling layer is typically much smaller.

command-line:
  title: Command line
  text: |
    A **command-line interface** (CLI) is a way of interacting with a computer using a sequence of commands entered as lines of text. Each typed command is submitted to the command line application by pressing "enter" and is run by the computer.

    On macOS, the command-line application is called *Terminal* and may be opened by spotlighting "Terminal" (do ⌘-spacebar and start typing "Terminal").

    The language for the Windows CLI is quite different from the standard one for macOS/Linux. We recommend ins
    talling the [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org) emulator so that you can learn to operate the command line in a cross-platform way.

int:
  title: int
  text: the standard integer type in Python

float:
  title: float
  text: the standard Python type for floating point numbers

str:
  title: str
  text: |
    The standard Python type for textual data

    ``` python
    myString = "Hello world!"
    myString[0] # returns "H"
    myString[3:] # returns "lo world!"
    dir(str) # to see all of the string methods
    ```

list-math:
  title: List
  text: A list is a finite, ordered collection of items. Lists are different from sets because they are ordered and allow elements to be repeated.

list:
  title: List
  text: |
    A mutable data type for storing an ordered sequence of objects.

    ``` python
    L = [5, "Hello", "world", 6, [1,2,3]]
    L[0] # returns 5
    L[4][1] # returns 2
    ```

listcomp:
  title: List Comprehension
  text: |
    Special syntax for generating lists by mapping and filtering. To remove the elements of _{code}L_ not satisfying a condition _{code}cond_ and apply a function _{code}f_ to the remaining elements:

    _{pre}[f(x) for x in L if cond(x)]_

    The _{code}if_ clause may be omitted.

    _{pre}[x**2 for x in range(5)
            if x % 2 == 0]_

    returns _{code}[0, 4, 16]_

tuple:
  title: tuple
  text: |
    An immutable data type for storing an ordered sequence of objects.

    _{pre}T = (5, "Hello", "world",
         6, (1,2,3))
    T[0] # returns 5
    T[4][1] # returns 2_

function-set:
  title: Function
  text: A function from a set $A$ to another set $B$ is an assignment of some element of $B$ to each element in $A$.

function:
  title: Function
  text: |
    A packaged block of related code for performing a specific computation or action. Values to be input are called **parameters**, and they can be given default values:

    _{pre}def add(x, y, z=0):
        return x + y + z_

    _{pre}add(3,2) # returns 5
    add(3,2,z=7) # returns 12_

dictionary:
  title: Dictionary
  text: |
    An unordered, mutable data type used for encoding a function whose domain is a finite set

    For example, if we set

    _{code}D = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}_,

    then the expression _{code}D['b']_ returns _{code}2_.

method:
  title: method
  text: |
    A function associated with a specific class and called using dot syntax from an instance of that class.

    For exapmle, in _{code}",".join([1,2,3])_, _{code}","_ is a string and _{code}join_ is a method of the string class.

package:
  title: Package
  text: A package is a collection of code that is distributed by the authors and may be loaded by a user to extend the functionality of the language.

rounding:
  title: Floating point representation
  text: |
    A real number typically has to be rounded by about $10^{-16}$ times its absolute value to be represented as a float. For example, the difference between $\sqrt{2}$ and the float which is closest to $\sqrt{2}$ is about $9.66 \times 10^{-17}$.

    However, numbers which are rational with a power of 2 in the denominator (including integers) can typically be represented exactly. Exceptions are when the number itself is very large or when the power of 2 in the denominator is very large.

syntax:
  title: Syntax
  text: |
    Syntax refers to the textual **form** of a given construct in a programming language. Examples:

    Indexing: _{code}myList[0], myDict["green"]_

    Named functions: _{code}myFunction(x)_

    Anonymous functions: _{code}lambda x,y: x**y_

    Lists: _{code}[1, 2, 3]_

    Tuples: _{code}(1, 2, 3)_

    Dictionaries: _{code}{"a": 1, "b": 2}_

    Dot syntax: _{code}module.function, object.attribute, object.method()_

immutable:
  title: Immutable
  text: |
    A type is immutable if the values it stores cannot be changed. For example,

    _{pre}T = (1, 2, 3)
    T[1] = 4_

    throws an error, because tuples are immutable. Changes in mutable data structures can be handled by assigning **new** instances of the type to the variable:

    _{pre}T = (1, 2, 3)
    T = (T[0], 4, T[2])_

    Dictionaries, lists, and sets are mutable.

linearcombination:
  title: Linear Combination

      \ldots, \mathbf{v}\_k$ is an expression of the form

    ``` latex
    c_1\mathbf{v_1} + c_2\mathbf{v_2}  + \cdots + c_k\mathbf{v_k},
    ```

     where $c_1, \ldots, c_k$ are real numbers. The $c$'s are called the **weights** of the linear combination.

basisequality:
  title: Basis equality theorem
  text: |
    Two linear transformations from $V$ to $W$ which agree on a basis of $V$ agree everywhere on $V$.

    In other words, $L_1(\mathbf{x}) = L_2(\mathbf{x})$ for every $\mathbf{x}$ in a basis of $V$ implies that $L_1(\mathbf{x}) = L_2(\mathbf{x})$ for all $\mathbf{x} \in V$, if $L_1$ and $L_2$ are linear transformations from a vector space $V$ to a vector space $W$.

matrixvectormultiplication:
  title: Matrix-vector multiplication
  text: |
    If $A$ is an $m\times n$ matrix and $\mathbf{x}$ is a column vector in $\mathbb{R}^n$, then $A\mathbf{x}$ is defined to be the linear combination of the columns of $A$ with weights given by the entries of $\mathbf{x}$.

algebraically:
  title: algebraically
  text: |
    Mathematical reasoning is *algebraic* if it involves the manipulation of symbols representing mathematical objects. Algebraic reasoning complements geometric reasoning, which involves figures or other non-symbolic visualizations.

    For example, $(a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2$ may be proved algebraically using the distributive property or geometrically by representing the left side as the area of an $(a+b) \times (a+b)$ square and the right side as the sum of the areas of four rectangles into which the square is divided.

geometrically:
  title: geometrically
  text: |
    Mathematical reasoning is *geometric* if it involves spatial representations of the mathematical objects under consideration. Geometric reasoning complements algebraic reasoning, which involves symbolic manipulations.

    For example, $(a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2$ may be proved algebraically using the distributive property or geometrically by representing the left side as the area of an $(a+b) \times (a+b)$ square and the right side as the sum of the areas of four rectangles into which the square is divided.

potato-and-arrow:
  title: Potato-and-arrow Diagram
  text: A figure which represents sets as blobs and functions as a collection of arrows between the blobs. Each arrow goes from a point in the domain to its image in the codomain.

codomain:
  title: Codomain
  text: The **codomain** of a function from one set $A$ to another set $B$ is the set $B$. The codomain must be specified as part of the function's definition, and there is no guarantee that every element of the codomain has any preimages in the domain. Codomain is similar to **range**, but the range of a function includes only those elements of the codomain which have preimages in the domain.
  image: range.svg

productcolumnrule:
  title: Product Column Rule
  text: |
    Given matrices $A$ and $B$, the $k$th column of $AB$ is the product of $A$ and the $k$th column of $B$:

    ``` latex
    AB &= A[\begin{array}{cccc}\mathbf{b}_1 & \mathbf{b}_2 & \cdots & \mathbf{b}_n\end{array}] \\
    &= [\begin{array}{cccc} A\mathbf{b}_1 & A\mathbf{b_2} & \cdots & A\mathbf{b}_n\end{array}],

    For example, if $A = \begin{bmatrix}
      	1 & 2 & 3 \\\\\\
      	4 & 5 & 6
      \end{bmatrix},$ then $A' =\begin{bmatrix}
      	1 & 4 \\\\\\
      	2 & 5 \\\\\\
      	3 & 6
      \end{bmatrix}.$

    \begin{bmatrix}
      A & B \\\ C & D
    \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}
      E & F \\\ G & H
    \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}

fullrank:
  title: Full rank
  text: A matrix has **full rank** if its rank is as large as allowed by its dimension. In other words, a matrix has full rank if its rank is equal to its number of rows or number of columns, whichever is smaller.

norm:
  title: Norm
  text: The **norm** of a vector is the distance from its tail to its head. It may be computed as the square root of the sum of the squares of the components of the vector.

rankdeficient:
  title: Rank deficient
  text: A matrix is rank deficient if it is not full rank. Rank deficiency implies linearly dependent columns and linearly dependent rows.

multiple-extension:
  title: Multiple extension principle
  text: If a basis of the intersection of two vector spaces is extended separately to bases of the two vector spaces, then the resulting compiled list of basis vectors is linearly independent.

    The **indicator** of an event $E$ is the random variable which returns 1 for each $\omega$ in $E$ and returns 0 for every other $\omega$.

independence-product:
  title: Independence product formula
  text: |
    If $X$ and $Y$ are independent random variables, then $\mathbb{E}[XY] = \mathbb{E}[X]\mathbb{E}[Y]$. If $A$ and $B$ are independent events, then $\mathbb{P}(A \cap B) = \mathbb{P}(A)\mathbb{P}(B)$.

bernoulli:
  title: Bernoulli
  text: |
    The Bernoulli distribution with parameter $p \in [0,1]$ is the distribution which assigns mass $p$ to 1 and mass $1-p$ to 0. When $p = 1/2$, we call this distribution the *fair coin flip distribution*.

linearize:
  title: Linearize
  text: To **linearize** a differentiable function at a point is to treat it as though it were a linear function (specifically, the best linear approximation) near that point.

clairaut:
  title: Clairaut's theorem
  text: Suppose $f:D \to \mathbb{R}$, where $D$ is a disk in $\mathbb{R}^2$. If $\partial_x \partial_y f$ and $\partial_y \partial_x f$ exist and are continuous, then $\partial_x \partial_y f = \partial_y \partial_x f$ throughout $D$.

directional-derivative:
  title: Directional derivative
  text: |
    The derivative of a funtion $f$ in the $\mathbb{u}$ direction is given by $\nabla f\cdot \mathbf{u}$.

    There is therefore one direction in which $f$ increases most rapidly (the direction of $\nabla f$), and it increases in every direction which makes an acute angle with $\nabla f$.

chain-rule:
  title: Chain Rule
  text: |
    The derivative of a composition of differentiable functions is the product of the derivatives of the functions (evaluated at the relevant points): $(f(g(x)))' = f'(g(x))g'(x)$.

A **positive semidefinite** matrix $A$ is a symmetric matrix whose eigenvalues are all nonnegative. Equivalently, a matrix $A$ is positive semidefinite if $\mathbf{x}' A \mathbf{x} \ge 0$ for all $\mathbf{x}$.

directory:
  title: Directory
  text: Another term for *folder* in an operating system

unix-run:
  title: Run
  text: To *run* a command in Unix, you type it or paste it into the command line and press the return key.

executable:
  title: Executable
  text: An executable is a file that can be run by the operating system.

bash-options:
  title: Options
  text: |
    A bash **option** is an argument which is supplied to a bash command to modify the way it runs. For example, `{sh}ls` list the files in a directory, and `{sh}ls -l` lists them in long form (including more information about each file).

    Single-letter options usually begin with one dash, while longer option names usually begin with two dashes.

hidden-directory:
  title: Hidden Directory
  text: A directory whose name begins with `{sh} .` is hidden by default on Unix systems. This means that it doesn't show up in your operating system's file browser (unless you do `{sh} command-shift-.`, on macOS), and it isn't listed when you run `{sh} ls` at the command line (unless you supply the flag `{sh} -a` to see *all* files).

hash:
  title: Hash
  text: |
    A **hash function** is any function that maps data of arbitrary size to data of fixed size.

    Hash functions often have two additional properties:

      (1) Even small changes to the input usually result in substantial changes to the output. For example, the SHA-1 hash function maps "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" to 2fd4e1c67a2d28fced849ee1bb76e7391b93eb12 and "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy **c**og" to de9f2c7fd25e1b3afad3e85a0bd17d9b100db4b3.

      (2) It's computationally challenging to invert the function. Hash functions with this property are useful for cryptographic purposes (such as verifying the integrity of a file downloaded from the internet).

git-clone:
  title: Git Clone
  text: |
    Create a local copy of a remote Git repository.

    For example, running `{sh} git clone git@github.com:data- gymnasia/python-binder.git` puts a directory called `{sh} python-binder` in the current directory. The directory contains the latest version of the repository files, along with a `{sh} .git` subdirectory that contains the commit history of the project. The URL for a GitHub repository is available under the green *Clone or Download* pulldown on the repository page.

binary-file:
  title: Binary File
  text: |
    A **text file** is a file whose contents are stored as text, and a **binary file** is a file which is not a text file.

    For example, a C program is specified in a text file and then *compiled* to an executable file that the computer can run. The executable is binary.

    We say that "binaries are available" for a given unit of software if users can download executable files to run the software. The alternative is that only the source code is available for download, and the user must "build from source" on their own computer before they can run the software.

YAML:
  title: YAML
  text: |
    YAML stands for "yet another markup language" and is commonly used format for configuration files. Here's an example YAML file:

REPL:
  title: REPL
  text: A *REPL*, or *read-eval-print-loop*, is a programming environment which takes user input at a command prompt, evaluates it, prints any results, and gives the user another prompt for further input.

refactoring:
  title: Refactoring
  text: |
    **Code refactoring** is changing the structure of a unit of code without changing its effect. For example, the lines

    ``` python
    root1 = (-b + sqrt(b^2-4*a*c))/(2*a)
    root2 = (-b - sqrt(b^2-4*a*c))/(2*a)
    ```

    might be refactored into

    ``` python
    Δ = b^2-4*a*c
    root1 = (-b + sqrt(Δ))/(2*a)
    root2 = (-b - sqrt(Δ))/(2*a)
    ```

linting:
  title: Linting
  text: |
    A **code linter** takes a program as input and identifies opportunities to improve the code's style.

    For example, a linter might suggest replacing `{py} x=3` with `{py} x = 3`.

  text: Python code execution in VS Code is done either through an integrated terminal or using a Jupyter notebook kernel running behind the scenes. To activate the Jupyter option, go to the Marketplace, right click the gear icon on the Python extension, and enter "send selection" in the search bar. Check the box for "Send Selection to Interactive Window".

boilerplate:
  title: Boilerplate
  text: Chunks of code that are typically used with little modification. Requiring extensive boilerplate is generally considered undesirable, because of the unnecessary code chunk management it imposes on the programmer and its obscuration of what aspects of the program are most important.

abtesting:
  title: A/B Testing
  text: An **A/B test** is a randomized experiment for assessing the difference between two variations (called A and B). For example, if you want to test whether changing the design of your credit card payment page leads to more completed transactions, you might randomly show half of the customers the new design and measure the transaction completion rates for the two groups.
  
R:
  title: R
  text: R is a popular open source programming language for data science. Python and R are by far the most prominent two programming languages used in data science in industry and academia. R is heavily geared toward statistical applications and is very popular among research statisticians. Python is becoming increasingly popular in industry, where it benefits from its closer ties to the software development world.
  
iris:
  title: Iris dataset
  text: The Iris dataset records 4 measurements (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) for 50 flowers from each of three different species. The data set has become a staple of introductory data analysis materials. 
  
hadley:
  title: Hadley Wickham
  text: Hadley Wickham is the Chief Scientist at RStudio. He created an influential visualization library in R based on the *grammar of graphics* idea, which emphasizes a core set of building blocks and principled ways to combine them into more complex graphics. He also created several other packages applying similar ideas to data manipulation. This suite of packages, called the *tidyverse*, has become the de facto standard for data visualization and manipulation in R. 
  
python-sets:
  title: Sets
  text: In Python, a `{py} set` is a data structure with efficient support for insertion, deletion, and membership checking. As in math, elements of a sets are unordered and repetitions are ignored. The basic set operations for two sets `{py} s` and `{py} t` are `{py} s & t` for intersection, `{py} s | t` for union, `{py} s - t` for set difference (elements in the first set but not the second), and `{py} s ^ t` for symmetric difference (elements in exactly one of the two sets).
  
allocation:
  title: Allocation
  text: To store an array or other data structure, the computer must **allocate** memory for it and insert the appropriate data. For example, when you execute `{py} pos_inds = (a > 0)` where `{py} a` is a NumPy array of length 1,000,000, one million new memory addresses are dedicated to storing the entries of `{py} pos_inds`, and those bytes are filled with `{py} True`s and `{py} False`s. Depending on what you want to do with `{py} pos_inds`, this operation might be wasteful.
  
splat:
  title: Splatting
  text: In Python, you can supply the contents of a list as arguments to a function by putting an asterisk in front of the list name when calling the function. For example `{py} f(*[1,2,3])` is the same as `{py} f(1,2,3)`. Likewise, you can supply the contents of a dictionary as keyword arguments. For example, `{py} f(**{'a': 1, 'b': 2})` is the same as `{py} f(a=1,b=2)`. This is useful when want to manage arguments programatically rather than having to type them in when you call the function.
  
mpl3d:
  title: 3D in Matplotlib
  text: Matplotlib does not support true 3D graphics. You can make 3D figures, but for every pair of objects in the scene, one will be rendered entirely in front of the other. This leads to inaccuracies if the scene is relatively complex. See the Matplotlib [FAQ page](https://matplotlib.org/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/faq.html) for more details.
